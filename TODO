Simple Typed Lambda calculus + References

Primitives 
  Unit
 
See pg 160 - 161
Values
Terms 


References (At the moment contains only unit)
Heap (List) and references are indeces
Context (De Bruijn indeces)

Semantics:
  Small Step
  Big Step
  Denotational Semantics

Based on what he wants us to proof choose the best.

Properties
  Progress - Preservation
  Completness - Soundness

Are they indipendent properties?

Steps:
0) Define datatypes Values Terms Context and Heap [MV]
      Use GADTs to encode only well type terms
   Semantics [PH]
   Prove Properties (Progress - Preservation) [OP]
   
1) General type in references
2) Ask wouter
